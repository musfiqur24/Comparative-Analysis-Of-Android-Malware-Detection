# Comparative Analysis Of Android Malware Detection
 This study investigates the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees in Android malware detection, focusing on analyzing and comparing the performance of these machine learning models in recognizing and preventing malicious applications on Android devices. Key features used for detection include app permissions, API requests, and other critical indicators of potential threats. The research emphasizes the importance of feature selection, employing techniques such as Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) to enhance model performance. The methodology involves a comprehensive workflow, starting with data collection and preprocessing, followed by the implementation of SVM and Decision Tree models. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experiments are conducted to fine-tune the models and optimize their parameters for the best possible results. Results indicate that while both models are effective in detecting Android malware, SVM demonstrates slightly higher accuracy and precision compared to Decision Trees. However, Decision Trees offer better recall, making them more suitable for applications requiring higher sensitivity. The findings suggest that a hybrid approach combining both models could potentially yield superior performance in real-world scenarios. This study concludes by highlighting the advantages and limitations of each model, offering insights into their practical implications for enhancing Android malware detection systems.
